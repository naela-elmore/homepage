I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas's School of [Economic, Political, and Policy Sciences (EPPS)](https://epps.utdallas.edu/). My research interests revolve around the intersection of social resistance dynamics, autocratic behavior, and traditional and digital repression in political activism, with a regional focus on the [Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA)](https://aapirc.ucsc.edu/swana/what-is-swana.html) region. My passion for the study of civil resistance dynamics was ignited by my involvement in the [Tahrir Square protests](https://merip.org/2011/04/the-18-days-of-tahrir/), where witnessing firsthand the power of collective action and non-violent resistance in effecting social change erupted my fervent commitment to understanding the dynamics and complexities of civil resistance movements.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Through my dissertation project, titled "Resistance Reimagined: Digital Tools, Physical Spaces, and the Evolution of State Repression in MENA", I embark on a multifaceted exploration comprising of three distinct papers that investigate the strategic interplay between civil resistance movements and state repression in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with particular attention to the evolving digital dimension of this contestation. Through a mixed-methods approach combining spatial analysis of protest events, comparative case studies, and digital trace data, I develop a comprehensive framework for understanding how authoritarian regimes calibrate their repressive responses across physical and digital domains.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

The *first* component of my research addresses a critical gap in the literature by demonstrating how proximity to strategic locations influences protest-repression dynamics, offering novel insights into the spatial determinants of contentious politics that challenge existing geographic models of collective action. The *second* paper documents the varied digital repression strategies employed by MENA regimes and explains cross-national variation in their implementation, contributing substantially to emerging scholarship on digital authoritarianism by providing empirical evidence of how states adapt traditional coercive methods to online spheres of contention. In the *final* section, I introduce a decision-making model that accounts for when and how regimes deploy different repressive tactics, advancing theoretical understanding of state strategic calculus in response to civil resistance by integrating spatial, temporal, and digital dimensions of contentious interaction. By bridging traditional protest politics literature with emerging scholarship on digital authoritarianism, this research advances our understanding of contentious politics in hybrid media environments and offers insights into the resilience of both resistance movements and authoritarian regimes in the post-Arab Spring era. The findings have significant implications for both scholarly debates on state-society relations in authoritarian contexts and practical considerations for civil society organizations navigating increasingly sophisticated regimes of repression.

Born and raised in [Cairo, Egypt](https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/cairo); I have long been passionate about understanding the political and social dynamics of political behavior and participation in the SWANA region. When I'm not immersed in academic pursuits and seminal works, you can often find me attempting to master the art of baking. My kitchen adventures have led to some interesting results, including a memorable incident where I mistook salt for sugar in a cake recipe. Needless to say, it was a learning experience that left me with a new found appreciation for precision in both research and baking!
