      subtitle: ''
      text: 'In my role as an educator, I have had the privilege of designing and instructing three distinct courses, each tailored to cultivate a deep understanding of key concepts in comparative politics and the dynamics of protests and social movements.
      
      My teaching philosophy centers on fostering critical thinking, analytical skills, and a nuanced understanding of global political systems among students. Through engaging lectures, interactive discussions, and innovative assignments, I aim to empower learners to analyze complex political phenomena, evaluate diverse perspectives, and develop informed opinions.'
