# Abstract 
This project explores civil grievances and social movements in the Southwest and North African (SWANA) region, focusing particularly on Lebanon, where social media's increasing prominence allows researchers to closely monitor citizen participation, grievance expression, and resurgence. The study aims to investigate whether civil grievances reemerge after the initial success of protest campaigns, drawing on protest and grievance literature to analyze issues the citizenry publicly dissents against and the methods used to express dissent to the state and its governing body. Specifically, it examines trends in Lebanon, known for its frequent demonstrations and heavy use of Twitter during social uprisings, comparing two significant social movements: the Arab Spring of 2011 and the more recent October Revolution of 2019. Through a comparative approach, the study seeks to determine whether the same issues and forms of grievances from the 2011 movement resurface nine years later.
