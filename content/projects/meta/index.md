# Abstract 
In this study, I conduct a meta-analysis of scholarly literature to examine the factors influencing protest outcomes and government responses in the Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) region. I aim to answer two main research questions: Firstly, what are the key factors determining the success or failure of protests in the SWANA region? Secondly, what are the common tactics employed by governments to suppress social movements in this region?

To collect data, I scrape articles from Google Scholar using relevant keywords related to protest success factors and government suppression tactics in the SWANA region. I refine my search queries iteratively to ensure comprehensive coverage of the scholarly literature. Subsequently, I extract and compile pertinent data points, including protest outcomes, influencing factors, government responses, and regional context.

The collected data undergoes rigorous analysis, including coding of variables, calculation of effect sizes, and meta-analysis techniques. Through statistical analysis, I aim to identify patterns, trends, and relationships among the variables under investigation. By synthesizing findings from diverse scholarly sources, this meta-analysis offers insights into the drivers and dynamics of protests, as well as the strategies employed by governments to maintain control in the SWANA region.

This research has significant implications for scholars, policymakers, and activists interested in understanding and addressing political instability, social unrest, and democratization processes in the SWANA region. By uncovering the underlying factors that contribute to protest outcomes and shedding light on government suppression tactics, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics shaping political and social change in the SWANA region.
