# Abstract 

This paper examines how autocratic regimes use digital repression tactics â€“ such as censorship, monitoring, and blocking before and after protest campaign mobilizations, especially in the context of the pre- and post-Arab Spring within the Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) region. In carrying out a time series regression analysis, this paper explores the types of online information and engagement that are most vulnerable to surveillance and manipulation, the influence of China's DSR initiative on SWANA countries' digital policies, and the variation in digital repression levels across SWANA countries.
