# Abstract 

This contribution is an extension on the original paper, Nonviolent Resistance Cam- paigns – A Temporal Examination. As with the preceding work, this article replicates and extends Stephan and Chenoweth’s (2013) article. This paper asks whether nonviolent resistance campaigns are temporally durable? This paper extends on nonviolent resistance literature, arguing that while such campaigns do achieve in the moment success in terms of campaign objective achievement, NVRCs do not sustain long-term success. Utilizing Stephan and Chenoweth’s (2013) dataset, I replicate and temporally extend the large-N dataset, and find support for my argument. Countries that experi- enced successful NVRCs initially, ended up experiencing increased protest occurrences in the years following the initial NVRC success.
