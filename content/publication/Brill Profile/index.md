abstract: In exploring the impact of state fragility on COVID-19 responses, particularly in the Middle East, this opinion piece sheds light on significant disparities in policy reactions. Drawing from data analysis and frameworks by Carment and Osaghae and the CoronaNet Researhc Project, the piece reveals a stark contrast between politically and economically robust countries' measured approach and fragile states' struggles with implementing effective measures. Despite challenges in data transparency, the piece advocates for increased openness and citizen involvement in policymaking to tackle pandemic challenges more effectively. Ultimately, it underscores the urgent need for collaborative efforts and interdisciplinary approaches to navigate the complexities of global crises.
